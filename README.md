### Business Goal

Perform an exploratory analysis using healthcare patient's datasets and develop an interactive dashboard that provides insights on the key influencing factors on heart disease and hypertension for our client, Anthem Healthcare, a healthcare insurance company.

### Data Sources

Key data sources used in this analysis are:
- Epic EHR System
- Microsoft Excel
- Tableau

### Analysis Approach

The data for this analysis is to determine top influencing factors for both diseases. For this analysis, I
utilized Microsoft Excel and Tableau to analyze, visualize, and generate a comprehensive data story. As
such, I:
- Cleaned, and prepared the dataset.
- Explored the dataset through visualization techniques.
- Present key insights based on existing data.
- Make recommendations that will promote healthy living.


### Key Insights

- Patients were categorized as the following age group:
  - Gen_Z: less than 26 yrs,
  - Millennials: 27 yrs - 42 yrs,
  - Gen_X: 43 yrs - 58 yrs,
  - Boomers_II: 59 yrs - 68 yrs,
  - Boomers_I : 69 yrs - 77 yrs,
  - Post_war: 78 yrs and above.

- The higher incidence of both diseases in young adults and could be related to genetic factors, changes in lifestyle, and the stress that comes with transitions.

- Studies have indicated a potential correlation between hypertension and marital stress. Stress is recognized as a risk factor for hypertension, and a number of marriage and relationship-related issues can raise stress levels.

- It is commonly known that smoking increases the risk of heart disease and hypertension. The smoking habit here confirms why the Gen X is the second largest group down with both diseases.

- A higher BMI considerably raises the risk of heart disease and hypertension because of things like increased arterial resistance and blood volume, especially in the overweightor obese categories.
  
- About half of the Gen X age group is classified as obese.

- The largest percentage of people with diabetes and prediabetes are in the Gen X age group.
  
- High blood sugar is linked to a higher risk of heart disease and hypertension, especially in those with diabetes or insulin resistance.

- Private sector employees are more vulnerable to both diseases due to things like long work hours, stress from the job, sitting at desks all day, and not getting enough exercise. Heart problems are more common in this group due to the demanding nature of work in the private sector and possible lifestyle factors like poor eating habits.


  ### Recommendation

- With smoking being a major modifiable risk factor for both hypertension and heart disease, it is important to establish and support programs to help people quit smoking.
  
- Encourage campaigns that promote balanced diets, frequent exercise, healthy lifestyles, and weight control. These interventions focus on important variables that contribute to the development of both diseases, such as a high body mass index and sedentary lifestyles.
  
- Incorporate stress management initiatives into the workplace, particularly for workers in high-stress settings, to lessen the negative effects of stress on heart disease and hypertension. This could involve work-life balance plans, mental health services, and wellness programs.
  
- Promoting routine health screenings can help with early detection and treatment of heart disease and hypertension, especially for those in the high-risk groups that have been identified.
